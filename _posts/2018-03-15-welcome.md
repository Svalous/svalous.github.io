## Hey there!


My name is Nicholas Ragusa, welcome to my blog!


Here I talk about projects I've been working on, thoughts I've been having, books I've been reading, etc!  I'm currently a senior at NYU studying Computer Science, and I plan on finishing up my BA this Spring, 2018.  I'm taking only one class this semester (intro to psychology, to fulfill a core requirement and learn a little about what goes on inside our collective noggins), so as of late I've got plenty of time to spend learning new things, making art, and applying for jobs!


Right now I have three projects I've been working on:
- CTRL, a video game made in Unity / C#
- [My instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nickfearsdolphins/) of glitch and pixel art, @nickfearsdolphins (yes, I am actually a little afraid of dolphins)
- [Make Play](http://www.podcasts.com/make-play-6ac13cd09), a podcast about game design and the lives of myself and my good friend Jimi Stine as consumers of digital media.


You can find links to both my instagram and my podcast above!  CTRL is hanging out in a private repository, but if you're curious about it or anything else feel free to send me a message at nick.m.ragusa@gmail.com!
