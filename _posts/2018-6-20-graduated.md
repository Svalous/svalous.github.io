title: Graduated!
---

## Hi again!

Been a while since my last update, I’ve been busy!  Graduated NYU with a BA in computer science, which I’ve immediately applied to my current internship doing IT work at Atlas Air whilst I wait for a full time position to come down the pipeline.

Had to take a break from glitch art for a month or so since I’ve started applying for jobs and working my internship from 9-5.  I wake up around 6am and get home around 6pm, so I’ve not had much time for personal projects!  Trying to make time for it all though.  Worked a little on CTRL this week, and hopefully making a little glitch art tonight or the day after.

Personal projects aside, work has been interesting!  Working with Team Foundation Server to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for a few .NET core applications.  Been reading Continuous Delivery by Jez Humble and David Farley for some theory background.  Definitely recommend it, though it was published in 2010 so some of the technologies they reference are out of date.  The theory, though, is certainly worth the read!

Anyhow, quite excited to find a full time job!  Hopefully moving into Brooklyn with friends by the end of September, so finding a job around Brooklyn or Manhattan would be perfect.

Ta ta for now!
